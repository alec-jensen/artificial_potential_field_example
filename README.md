# Artificial Potential Field Example

This repository demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm for path planning in a 2D environment with obstacles. The APF method uses attractive forces to pull an agent toward a goal and repulsive forces to push it away from obstacles, creating a navigation system that can smoothly guide an agent through complex environments.
